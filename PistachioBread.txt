Vegan Pistachio Bread
1 cup shelled pistachios, lightly toasted and finely chopped*
2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1/2 teaspoons salt
2/3 cups sugar
1 cup coconut milk
1/2 cup canola oil
2 teaspoons vanilla

1. Preheat your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.  Grease and flour 4 mini loaf pans or one regular loaf pan.

2. In a large bowl, whisk together your flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and sugar. Stir in your chopped pistachios. In a smaller bowl, whisk together your coconut milk, canola oil and vanilla.  Make a well in the center of your dry ingredients and pour in your wet ingredients. Fold with a spatula until just combined. Be careful to not over mix.

3. Spoon batter into prepared loaf pans. If desired, chop up an additional 1/2 cup of pistachios and sprinkle on top.

4. Bake in oven for 20-25 minutes (for mini-loaf pans), 40-45 minutes for regular loaf pan. A wooden toothpick should come out clean when stuck in middle of loaf. Allow to cool for five minutes in pan before removing to a wire rack. Allow to cool for 30-40 minutes before slicing.
