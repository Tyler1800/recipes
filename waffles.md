Waffles 
======================

*Yield*: 10-12 waffles (depending on your waffle iron)
*Total Time*: 25 minutes
*Active Time*: 15 minutes

## Ingredients

* 6 Tbs. garbanzo bean water 
* 1/2 cup vegetable oil
* 1 3/4 cups non-dairy milk (I prefer almond milk)
* 1 Tbs. sugar
* 4 Tbs baking powder
* 1/2 tsp. salt
* 2 cups all purpose flour

## Process

* Pre-heat your waffle iron. 
* Mix dry ingredients. 
* Mix vegetable oil and non-dairy milk and then combine with dry ingredients. 
* Beat garbanzo bean water until it is light and fluffy.(I used a hand mixer).
* Gently fold in the fluffy garbanzo bean water into the batter. 
* Pour with a cup or pitcher about 2-3 cups of the batter onto the waffle iron. 
* Cook until steaming stops, about 5 minutes. 
* Top with vegan butter, maple syrup, or whatever desired toppings. 

#### A Note on Garbanzo Bean Water
* Another name for this is aquafaba.
* I generally either keep the water from a can of garbanzo beans or from home cooking garbanzo beans. I recommend the latter as it usually tastes better and is less salty. EIther way, this water should be cooked down until it is about the consistancy of an egg white.
