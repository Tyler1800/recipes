Ingredients:
6 lb Tomatoes
2 Large Onions
3 Stalks Celery
1 Poblano Pepper
1 Head Garlic
1 Tbsp Dried Oregano
1 T sugar (Optional)
1-2 cups white beans (Optional)
~ 1/2 c Fresh Basil
~ 1/2 c Fresh Parsley
1/2 cup Red Wine
1/3 cup olive oil
Salt + Pepper, to taste

Peel tomatoes and put in blender/food processor or cut into small chunks.

Saute onions in a large pot with pepper and celery. After a few minutes, add the garlic. 

Cook for a minute then add sugar, dried herbs and the rest of the vegetables as well as salt and pepper.

Add salt and pepper and simmer for 90 to 120 minutes.

Near the end, add wine.

Remove from heat, and blend some of the sauce to the desired consistency. Add fresh herbs at the very end. 
Sauce should store fine for a week or two in the refrigerator, or perpetually in the freezer.
