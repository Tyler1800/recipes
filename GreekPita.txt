Makes about 8 pitas (~1 per 50g of flour)

Ingredients:

1 c warm water - 220g - 55%
2 tsp yeast - 6g - 1.5%
2.5 c flour - 400g - 100%
1 tsp salt - 5g - 1.25%
1 Tbsp olive oil - 10g - 2.5%

- Mix yeast together with warm water and let sit for a few minutes.
- In the meantime, mix flour and salt together in a large bowl.
- Combine yeast with flour and add oil. Mix well and then knead the dough well
    for about 10 minutes. The dough should be soft but not that sticky.
- Let the dough rise, covered lightly, for about an hour to 90 minutes.
- Form the dough into 8 or so portions and flatten each into a modest sized pita.
- The pita may be baked at very high temperature (and preferably on a baking stone),
    or prepared in a dry frying pan.
