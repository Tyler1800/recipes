* 1.5 cups dry short grain brown or long grain white rice

## Process

### Preparation
* For preparation, press and cut the tofu into small cubes. Transfer the tofu to a baking
sheet and bake for around 15 minutes.
* Either dice or food process the vegetables, placing them into a bowl, keeping onion and garlic separate
* Prepare the rice as per the directions for the type of rice using. Letting the rice
sit after cooking it increases the firmness of the fried rice, with chilled rice often
preferred to fresh rice.

* Fry for 2 minutes and add the tofu cubes. Fry for another two minutes.
* Add rice and stir so that the butter is well mixed in.

* Cook for a few minutes, stirring well, and add the vegetables and vinegar in.
* Cook for another 5 minutes, then remove from heat and serve.
