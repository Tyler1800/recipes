=============

* **Yields**: 6 servings
* **Active Time**: 90 minutes
* **Total Time**: At least 10 hours

## Ingredients

* 2 blocks of tofu
* 8 green onions
* 2 large onions
* 8 oz shiitake mushrooms

* 8 cloves garlic
* A few jalapeno peppers (optional)
* 2 tsp fresh ginger or 1 tsp powdered ginger
* 1.5 cups lower sodium soy sauce
* 1/4 cup sesame oil
* 3/4 cup mirin
* 1/2 cup rice vinegar
* 1/4 cup sriracha or hot sauce (optional, to taste)
* 1/2 cup shredded asian pear
* 1.5 cups vegetable broth or water

## Process
 
* Dice garlic cloves and peppers (if using).
* Mix together all ingredients from garlic down in a bowl and set aside.
* Slice tofu into slabs or preferred shape.
* Chop up the green onions and onion bulbs, slicing the bulbs into
  half-rings.
* Chop the mushrooms into strips if whole.

* Layer the tofu into a broad, rimmed pan that can hold all tofu, vegetables and sauce (a casserole pan works well).
* Sprinkle the green onions on top of the tofu, then add onions and mushrooms on top.
* Pour the sauce over the entire pan, then place the pan into the refrigerator at let sit for at least 8 hours. It works
  well to create the mixture the night before and then cook it the next day. 
* Strain off the sauce from the vegetables and tofu, and separate out the tofu into a baking sheet.
* Bake the tofu for 20-30 minutes at 425.

* Heat a frying pan with some oil. Add the tofu and fry for 5 minutes at high heat.
* Add a cup of the sauce to the tofu and fry for another 10 minutes until the sauce forms
  a glaze on the tofu.
* Add the remaining vegetables and the rest of the sauce and heat for another 10-15 minutes.
* Serve over rice or noodles if desired.
