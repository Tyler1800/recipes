This bread is a modification of the Meusli and Date Bread recipe from "The Best-Ever Book of Bread" by Christine Ingram and Jennie Shapter
260 ml water
30ml canola oil
300g bread flour
45g whole wheat flour
30g mugwort powder
150g muesli (granola)
3 tbsp of milk powder
1.5 tsp salt
1.5 tsp yeast (dry active)
I wanted to make a green bread for Ireland's-sake. I was about use green tea to color it but found some mugwort powder in my "misc asian ingredients" cabinet. I mixed it and kneaded for ~15 minutes when rested for 40 min. Then I shaped it into 2 oblongs and placed it into 2 Pullman 9.5 in pans. I let it rise for 50 minutes and baked at 400F.
I didn't obtain a soft enough crumb and suspect it is both not enough water and not enough final proofing.
