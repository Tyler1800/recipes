1 can coconut milk
1 can coconut cream
1/4 cup light corn syrup
3/4 cup sugar
1 large bunch mint leaves (or 1 t peppermint extract)
3/4 t salt
2 T vanilla extract or contents of 2 vanilla beans.
2.5 oz crumbled chocolate; putting chocolate chips in a small food processor works well.

Mix together coconut, corn syrup and sugar. Bring to a light boil, stirring regularly, then remove from heat.
Add vanilla and mint. If using fresh leaves, steep leaves for at least 2 hours and then bring to a simmer again.
Blend the mixture briefly, add salt and chill both ice cream mixture and chocolate in a refrigerator for at least 3-4 hours.
Put ice cream mixture into an ice cream maker, adding the chocolate partway through the churning process.
Optionally, chill before consuming to increase firmness.
