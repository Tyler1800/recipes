## Bread Instructtions

### Ingredients
* 725g flour (225 g for 1 loaf)
* 15g salt (7.5 g for 1 loaf)
* 10g yeast (5g for 1 loaf)
* 350-450g water (25-50g for 1 loaf)

  fingers.
* Add the yeast and mix it into the flour like the salt.
* Add the water and mix everything together until it is mostly incorporated.
* Place the dough on a counter or other large surface and knead vigorously for approximately 10 minutes.
* Once kneaded, let the bread rest, lightly covered, for about one hour.
* Divide the dough into 2 parts (if making two loaves), then shape the dough. Let the shaped dough
  sit for another 30-45 minutes.
* Preheat the oven to 500 F.
* Before placing the dough in the oven, with wet hands, lightly wet the top of the loaves.
* Place the dough into the oven and spray the inside of the oven with water.
* Reduce oven temperature to 450 F once the dough is inside.
* Bake for approximately 23-26 minutes. The top should become deep brown.
* For best results, let the warm bread sit before cutting for at least 15 minutes.
