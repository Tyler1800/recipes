Greek Pita
==========

* **Yield**: About 8 pitas (1 per 50g of flour)
* **Total Time**: 2 hours
* **Active Time**: 45 min

## Ingredients

* 1 cup / 220g / 55% warm water
* 2 tsp / 6g / 1.5% yeast
* 2.5 cup / 400g / 100% flour
* 1 tsp / 5g / 1.25% salt
* 1 Tbsp / 14g / 2.5% olive oil

## Process

* Mix together flour, yeast and salt, ensuring that the salt does not come into direct
  contact with the yeast.
* Add oil to the flour mixture and mix in well.
* Add the warm water and form into a dough. Knead the dough for approximately 10 minutes,
  until the dough becomes soft and elastic without being sticky.
* Let the dough rise covered for about an hour.
* Form the dough into around 8 balls, making them smooth and without big seams.
* Let the balls of dough rest for 10 to 15 minutes and then roll them out into
  flat pita.
* Let each pita sit for a few minutes before cooking.

### Cooking

* The pita may be either baked or heated on a skillet.

#### Baking Method

* Place each of the pita on baking sheets. If you have a pizza stone, preheat the oven with that
  in first.
* Preheat the oven to 500 °F, then place the pita into the oven and turn it down to 450 °F.
* Bake for 8-10 minutes.

#### Stove-top Method

* Preheat a cast-iron or similar pan with high heat capacity on the stove.
* Place a single pita at a time into the pan, heating it for a few minutes and then flipping
  it.
* Remove from heat when both sides are slightly blackened or to preference, then immediately
  start next pita.
